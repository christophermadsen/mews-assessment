StaysInWeekNights:** Guests tend to have shorter stays\n    at `H2` compared to `H1`, in both weekdays and weekends.\n-   **Children / Babies:** `H2` has a slightly fewer number of `Children` and\n    `Babies` on bookings on average. This may mean `H2` caters more to business\n    trips (as supported by the shorter stays) or to couples/adults travelling\n    without children.\n-   **IsRepeatedGuest:** `H1` has about a **2%** higher rate of repeat customers than\n    `H2`. This could mean a number of things, for example that the hotel has been\n    operating longer, that guests are more satisfied or that the hotel is better\n    at handling guest retention.\n-   **BookingChanges:** It seems that `H1` has a higher rate of booking changes,\n    about **0.10** higher than `H2`. This could mean `H1` is more flexible or that\n    there is more need for changes.\n-   **DaysInWaitingList:** `H2` has a signficantly higher waiting list time at\n    about **3.22 days** compared to the about **0.52 days** in `H1`. This could\n    either mean there is a higher demand or less immediate availability in `H2`.\n-   **ADR:** The Average Daily Rate is about **10** higher in `H2`. This makes sense\n    since it's a resort hotel and `H1` is a city hotel.\n\nFurthermore, a few possible anomalies stand out:\n\n-   The **max** ADR at `H2` is **5400**, which could be an expensive suite on the\n    resort, but we'll need to verify this.\n-   The **min** ADR at `H1` is a negative number and in `H2` is **0.0**, we'll need\n    to investigate if this makes sense.\n-   The **max** number of **adults** on a booking at `H1` is **55**, this seems high,\n    so let's have a look at that too. It could be a special case made for a\n    booking of many rooms at once.\n-   The **max** number of `PreviousCancellations` and `PreviousBookingsNotCanceled`\n    seem very high in both `H1` and `H2`, but could be because the hotels allow\n    bookings to be made on the behalf of others, but with the customer unchanged,\n    that could fit in the case of someone at a business making bookings for\n    clients or employees.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Further Exploration of Numeric Features\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In the Descriptive Statistics section we found some interesting differences\nbetween `H1` and `H2` and some values that may be anomalies/outliers.
