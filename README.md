# MEWS Data Scientist Assessment
## Author: Christopher Buch Madsen

First of all, thank you for having a look at my assessment.


It doesn't have a normal Python project structure, but I hope it's organised in a way that isn't too difficult to get into :)

### TL;DR

Just read the `assessment.md` file.

### Installation
All code has been tested only in `Python 3.11.7`

Boot up a python environment and install the `requirements.txt`
``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This is all you need to run the code in the project.

### Overview
`requirements.txt` is the requirements file you can use to install the python
requirements with pip.

The `assessment.org` file is the original file where I wrote the assessment,
this is a file belonging to org-mode in Emacs, which I use for literate
programming.

The `assessment.md` is a github flavoured markdown file that I exported, I
recommend you read this file as it's easy on the eyes.

The `assessment.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook version of my org narrative, you
should be able to run it from start to finish without any issues if you've
install the requirements.

`models/` is where I've stored the models.

`data/` contains the data files provided for the assessment.

`figures/` contains .png figures generated throughout the code.

`references/` contains PDF references for the assessment.

`README.md` is the file you're currently reading.

**NOTICE**! If you for some reason don't know how to read a Markdown file, have
a look at this amazing tool: https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer

Thanks for reading!~
